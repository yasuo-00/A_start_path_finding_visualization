# Path Finding Algorithm Visualization

# About
Python program to visualize graphically how different algorithms works to find the path between two points (two nodes in a graph). 
Includes Breadth-First-Search, Depth-First-Search and A* algorithms.

# Dependencies
* Pygame
* Numpy

# How to install dependencies
```
$ pip3 install pygame
$ pip3 install numpy
```

# How to use
 ***Controls***:

* ***Mouse***
  * Left Click: set origin/destination node
  * Hold down left click: set walls (after origin and destination nodes were set)

* ***Keys***
  * E/e: use euclidean distance for heuristics
  * M/m: use Manhattan distance for heuristics
  * G/g: enable/disable diagonal move
  * R/r: reset board
  * A/a: start A* algorithm
  * B/b: start Breadth-First-Search algorithm
  * D/d: start Depth-First-Search algorithm

# How to run
